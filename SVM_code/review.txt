# Format of notebook:
# Give a diagram and explaination of the network
# importing libraries
# defining the helper function
# training
# plotting
# testing
# plotting 


# Questions to ask:
# 1. We need to ensure that every module finishes in its first oscillation (i think), so make a new network with not all oscillating
# 2. as doing odeint for basically 1 step, do  i really need to do it? can simply do x_t = x_t-1 + dxdt?
# 3. between oscillations, the transition causes change in concentration of other species Answer: space by 2 oscillations , o1 ,o2, then o3 and also introduce o4
# 4. Different species for read and write (not LHS and RHS in species)
# 5. jumbled order of instructions forces us to include change threshold update. do u want that?


# Things to do:
# 1. formalise the notebook, by adding markdowns
# 2. check reviews once

# Things for meet
1. show that the common and different oscillations do work
2. confirm that i am comparing Q+ and Q- + 1
3. comparing works at o1 . am ot o3 but obviously when o1 starts, it goes back to og
4. confirm weight update part and sum  also works at 03
5. final update in o5

things to do
random weights
batch and cycling thru
increase time limit
y can be -1
convergence
