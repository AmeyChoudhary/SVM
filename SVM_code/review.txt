# Format of notebook:
# Give a diagram and explaination of the network
# importing libraries
# defining the helper function
# training
# plotting
# testing
# plotting 


# Questions to ask:
# 1. We need to ensure that every module finishes in its first oscillation (i think), so make a new network with not all oscillating
# 2. as doing odeint for basically 1 step, do  i really need to do it? can simply do x_t = x_t-1 + dxdt?
# 3. between oscillations, the transition causes change in concentration of other species Answer: space by 2 oscillations , o1 ,o2, then o3 and also introduce o4
# 4. Different species for read and write (not LHS and RHS in species)
# 5. jumbled order of instructions forces us to include change threshold update. do u want that?


# Things to do:
# 1. formalise the notebook, by adding markdowns
# 2. check reviews once
