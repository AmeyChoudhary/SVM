# Format of notebook:
# Give a diagram and explaination of the network
# importing libraries
# defining the helper function
# training
# plotting
# testing
# plotting 


# Questions to ask:
# 1. We need to ensure that every module finishes in its first oscillation (i think), so make a new network with not all oscillating
# 2. as doing odeint for basically 1 step, do  i really need to do it? can simply do x_t = x_t-1 + dxdt?
# 3. between oscillations, the transition causes change in concentration of other species Answer: space by 2 oscillations , o1 ,o2, then o3 and also introduce o4
# 4. Different species for read and write (not LHS and RHS in species)
# 5. jumbled order of instructions forces us to include change threshold update. do u want that?


# Things to do:
# 1. formalise the notebook, by adding markdowns
# 2. check reviews once

# Things for meet
1. show that the common and different oscillations do work
2. confirm that i am comparing Q+ and Q- + 1
3. comparing works at o1 . am ot o3 but obviously when o1 starts, it goes back to og
4. confirm weight update part and sum  also works at 03
5. final update in o5

things to do
random weights
batch and cycling thru
increase time limit
y can be -1

convergence: 
dip when basically Q_p and Q-n change in order of who is greater
place of dip is dependant on order of weights and lr 
dip is natural as shown in hyperplane movement, loss is natural down and then increases so it moves into local minima and out of it
changing by current algorithm as always update to include stopping and dynamic lr
case 1 is not separable so always a factor of bgta  and regularizing so always updating but does cause to go closer 
in case 1 always so always moving, looks like convergence when lr * epochs = 10, 
case 2, no update, as below threshold value, but shall update always
